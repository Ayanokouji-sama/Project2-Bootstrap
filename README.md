Tindog
Tindog is a fun and playful website project that I created to practice my skills in HTML, CSS, and the Bootstrap framework. The site is a mock platform where dogs can meet and connect with each other, much like a dating app for dogs.

Features
Responsive Design: The website is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
Bootstrap Framework: Utilizes Bootstrap's grid system, components, and utilities to create a modern and clean design.
Custom Styling: Includes custom CSS to enhance the visual appeal and differentiate the site from standard Bootstrap themes.
Fun and Engaging UI: The design is playful and engaging, with dog-themed elements throughout.
Technologies Used
HTML5: The structure of the website is built using HTML5, providing a solid foundation for all content.
CSS3: Custom styles and animations are applied using CSS3, making the site visually appealing and interactive.
Bootstrap: The Bootstrap framework is used for its powerful grid system, responsive utilities, and pre-built components.
