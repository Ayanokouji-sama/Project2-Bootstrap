# Tindog

## Overview

Tindog is a fun and playful website project that I created to practice my skills in HTML, CSS, and the Bootstrap framework. The site is a mock platform where dogs can meet and connect with each other, much like a dating app for dogs.

## Features

- **Responsive Design:** The clone is fully responsive and adapts to various screen sizes, from mobile to desktop.
- **Bootstrap Framework:** Utilizes Bootstrap's grid system, components, and utilities to create a modern and clean design.
- **Custom Styling:** Includes custom CSS to enhance the visual appeal and differentiate the site from standard Bootstrap themes.
- **Fun and Engaging UI:** The design is playful and engaging, with dog-themed elements throughout.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5:** For structuring the webpage content.
- **CSS3:** For styling the webpage, including layout, colors, fonts, and responsiveness.
- **Bootstrap:** The Bootstrap framework is used for its powerful grid system, responsive utilities, and pre-built components.
